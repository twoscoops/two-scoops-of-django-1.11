Two Scoops of Django 1.11
===================================================

Tracking thoughts and feature requests for Two Scoops of Django 1.11 in the issue tracker.

Before You Submit an Issue
----------------------------

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the other issues for the previous version (1.8), open_ and closed_, to see if this issue already exists.
* Check the changelist_ to see if your issue has already been resolved.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by chapter, section, and subsection numbers. Since the content shifts around, and the PDF pages numbers do not match up with the book's, page numbers are next to useless.
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we will alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
